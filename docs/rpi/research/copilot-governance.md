# Copilot Governance Research for QA Delivery (https://www.saucedemo.com/)

Date: 2026-02-25  
Scope: Research only for repository structure, Playwright conventions, flakiness risks, and governance file requirements.

| facts | assumptions | unknowns | risks | evidence gaps | proposed governance files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Repository root shows Playwright scaffold structure (`playwright.config.ts`, `tests/`, `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`). | Current workspace reflects active QA delivery baseline. | Whether hidden branches contain additional test modules. | Governance may be under-scoped if unseen modules exist. | No visibility into private/non-loaded repos. | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (global baseline rules). |
| `package.json` includes `@playwright/test` `^1.58.2` and no additional E2E framework dependency. | Playwright remains the authoritative E2E framework. | Whether wrappers/utilities are consumed from external packages. | Mixed tooling outside visible scope could weaken rule consistency. | No custom QA package docs present in workspace. | `.github/instructions/playwright.instructions.md` (stack-specific Playwright rules). |
| Visible tests use semantic locators and web-first assertions across `tests/example.spec.ts` and `tests/checkout/login.spec.ts`. | Accessibility-first selectors should remain governance default. | Availability of stable `data-testid` attributes in AUT is unknown. | Role/text-only selectors may become brittle with UI copy changes. | No selector fallback policy tied to AUT components exists. | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; `.github/instructions/playwright.instructions.md`. |
| Visible tests use `goto`, action, assertion; no hard wait usage observed in current specs. | Assertion-driven waiting can be enforced as standard. | Wait patterns in hidden/private suites remain unknown. | Undetected hard waits outside visible scope could still drive flakiness. | No full-repo wait policy enforcement in CI. | `.github/instructions/playwright.instructions.md`; `.github/prompts/rpi-implement.prompt.md` (blocker checks). |
| Config sets CI retries to `2`, local retries to `0`, CI workers to `1`, trace `on-first-retry`, and three browser projects. | CI is intended as flake detection gate with retry diagnostics. | Whether CI runs all configured browsers consistently at scale. | Retry masking can hide deterministic failures if governance is weak. | No flake trend metrics, quarantine policy, or SLA defined. | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; `.github/agents/qa-delivery.agent.md`. |
| GitHub Actions workflow runs install + `npx playwright test` and uploads HTML report artifact. | Workflow is baseline quality gate for repository PRs. | Whether future matrix/sharding plans exist. | Single-job pipeline may hide browser/environment variance trends. | No explicit runtime SLO or flake analytics captured. | `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (evidence gate, already present). |
| Login surface is now represented by `tests/checkout/login.spec.ts` and `pages/login.page.ts`, with deterministic failing evidence for invalid-credential expectation mismatch. | This login spec is the primary stabilization baseline for current RPI track. | Whether additional checkout/login variants exist in hidden paths. | Single-spec coverage may miss other flaky paths and selectors. | No multi-scenario login inventory beyond current stabilization spec. | `.github/prompts/rpi-research.prompt.md` (evidence capture); `.github/agents/qa-delivery.agent.md` (pilot boundary). |
| User-reported defects: social buttons lead nowhere; sign-in can proceed without credentials. | Defects should anchor first governance pilot outcomes. | Expected product behavior contracts for each control are not defined in repo. | Click-only checks could miss real business failures. | No canonical expected-outcome matrix for login/social controls. | `.github/prompts/rpi-plan.prompt.md`; `.github/prompts/rpi-implement.prompt.md`. |
| `test-results/` directory is empty; report UI file exists but no machine-readable failure history present. | Evidence capture standards should be mandated before scale-up. | Historic error classes (timeout/detached/navigation) are not observable from current artifacts. | Governance could target hypothetical flake patterns without grounded evidence. | No retained traces/log summaries in repo. | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (evidence requirements); `.github/agents/qa-delivery.agent.md`. |
| Repository now contains RPI control-plane artifacts under `.github/prompts/`, `.github/instructions/`, and `.github/agents/`. | These files are intended to enforce stage-based governance behavior. | Whether all contributors/tools are configured to consume these artifacts consistently. | If discovery/usage is inconsistent, compliance may drift. | No automated validation that prompts/agents are recognized during PR flow. | `.github/prompts/rpi-research.prompt.md`, `.github/prompts/rpi-plan.prompt.md`, `.github/prompts/rpi-implement.prompt.md`, `.github/agents/qa-delivery.agent.md`. |
| Stage discipline is explicitly needed to keep RPI lifecycle enforceable (Research → Plan → Implement → Pilot). | Stage boundaries can prevent premature test generation and scope creep. | Exception/waiver process ownership remains unspecified. | Ambiguous exception ownership can create policy debt. | No RACI file or exception register found in visible repo. | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; `.github/agents/qa-delivery.agent.md`. |
| Mandatory blockers needed by governance include: no hard waits, no fragile selectors, no click-only outcomes, no retry masking, and required failure evidence. | Blocker rules can serve as merge gate criteria. | Degree of automation for blocker detection is unknown. | Manual-only review may be inconsistently enforced under pressure. | No CI policy lint/check mapping blockers to automated gates. | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; `.github/instructions/playwright.instructions.md`; `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. |
| Implement-stage governance artifacts were updated on 2026-02-25 only within approved allow-list paths from `docs/rpi/plan/copilot-governance.md` (instructions, agent contract, prompt schemas, PR checklist). | Approved plan controls can be made enforceable without scope expansion. | Prompt/agent recognition consistency in all contributor tooling remains unverified. | Rules may be inconsistently applied if local tooling ignores instruction artifacts. | No automated repository check yet validates prompt/agent schema conformance in CI. | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; `.github/instructions/playwright.instructions.md`; `.github/agents/qa-delivery.agent.md`; `docs/qa/*.prompt.md`; `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. |
